###Some notes:
- __DTO as Model__: I preferable call Model as DTO _(Data Transfer Object)_, I get this name from Mr. Koushik on his YouTube Channel, ![Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/user/koushks "Java Brains").
- __IDE__ : I used Eclipse JEE for this project, but I am not upload the ```.project``` and ```.settings``` file/folder here which is project descriptor for Eclipse. I think that I don't have to.
- __Errata__ : English is not my native language, some typo or vocabulary may be wrong. Tell me to correct this problem please...
